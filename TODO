functions: play, evaluate (play against random), train (save as name_number.ckpt after every n)
minimax needs to distinguish between my move equities and opponent's move equities
[Td.equity] should somehow batch tensorflow calls
save more often, separate input/output
two hidden layers? what sizes?
try to improve encoding: n>=3 instead of n==3, more inputs for the bar (and off)
train the network on p and (1-p) at the same time
wrap the above options in a config of some sort
rename equity to distinguish between functions and values

instead of minimax:
- alpha-beta pruning / negascout / mcts
- transposition table
- increase depth while gradually reducing width - select best k moves / use clustering to select die
  rolls
- probability of move has something to do with stability of likelihood of winning as well as the
  likelihood itself?

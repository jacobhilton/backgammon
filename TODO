make Master module
print board in scrollable way, showing the same perspective when scrolling
defaults used were: replay_memory_capacity = 100_000; train_every = 100; minibatch_size = 128; minibatches_number = 10_000
try just using 1-ply search and updating using the best move
enforce that equities are correct in winning states (at least for minimax)
functions: play, evaluate (play against random), train (save as name_number.ckpt after every n)
gammon pip count ratio (pip count to point 6 plus 1 if nothing borne off, divided by sum of that plus opponent ordinary pip count)
[Td.equity] should somehow batch tensorflow calls
save more often, separate input/output
two hidden layers? what sizes?
train the network on p and (1-p) at the same time
wrap the above options in a config of some sort
rename equity to distinguish between functions and values
report total score / gammon numbers too
regularization?

instead of minimax:
- alpha-beta pruning / negascout / mcts
- transposition table
- increase depth while gradually reducing width - select best k moves / use clustering to select die
  rolls
- probability of move has something to do with stability of likelihood of winning as well as the
  likelihood itself?
